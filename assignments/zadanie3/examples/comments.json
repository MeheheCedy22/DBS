I've seen Mac's with VNC server enabled get hacked before via that, although this looks like an SSH attempt. Looks like the IPs it was downloading from are hosted in China somewhere.",

Some interesting tests you can suggest to the tech guy.. What if they at their office from their laptop, ping one of their technicolour routers(ie locally at their office). Do they get the error you get? If so, then there you go. If not then what if they then take that router and their laptop to your place.  Then ping it(locally from your place), do they get the error. If so, then that can be investigated (e.g. is it the power in your home! who knows..!)..(cntd)",

And while you are at it, you can look at if there is a different in wireless/wifi issue between the router they brought in and the one they replaced it with.",

My ISP is Zen in the UK, they are pretty good and any router they use is usually reliable and they have used technicolor routers so technicolor routers might not b that unreliable.generally.Sometimes an ISP with 24/7 tech support can be useful but then the quality of the tech (like level 1 or 2),can b low until they move u up.",

ISPs retain SSH access to their routers for troubleshooting consumer issues, however the customer is then exposed to at least two types of data breaches: (1) rogue employees abusing their SSH access privileges; (2) an external data breach of the ISP's system(s) that may never become public, even if it's known about by the ISP.",
